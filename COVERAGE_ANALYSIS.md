# Code Coverage Analysis for attio-rails

## Current Coverage: 94.76% (940/992 lines)

## Uncovered Code Analysis & Recommendations

### 1. **Dealable Concern** (87.90% covered, 30 lines uncovered)

#### Critical Gaps:

**Error Handling Paths (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Lines 119, 233, 235, 252, 255, 257, 351: Error handling in various sync methods
- **Why Important**: These handle API failures, which are critical for production reliability
- **How to Cover**: 
  ```ruby
  # Test API errors during deal operations
  it "handles API errors when marking deal as won" do
    allow(deals_resource).to receive(:update).and_raise(Attio::Error, "API Error")
    deal.status = "won"
    expect { deal.sync_deal_to_attio_now }.to handle_error_appropriately
  end
  ```

**Callback Execution (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Line 80: `before_attio_deal_sync` callback
- Lines 137, 140-141: Callback error handling
- **Why Important**: Callbacks are user-extensible hooks
- **How to Cover**: Test with actual callback implementations

**Value Calculation Fallbacks (LOW PRIORITY)**
- Lines 290-291: Fallback to `amount` method
- Line 293: Return 0 when no value methods exist
- **Why Important**: Ensures correct deal values in various configurations
- **How to Cover**: Test deals without standard value fields

**Stage Field Resolution (LOW PRIORITY)**
- Lines 334-339: `current_stage_id` method with various field lookups
- **How to Cover**: Test with different stage field configurations

### 2. **WorkspaceManager** (88.67% covered, 17 lines uncovered)

#### Critical Gaps:

**Error Handling in Batch Operations (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Line 99: Failed user addition in batch operations
- Lines 181-182, 237-238: Error handling in workspace operations
- **Why Important**: Batch operations need proper error recovery
- **How to Cover**:
  ```ruby
  it "handles partial failures in batch member addition" do
    allow(client).to receive(:workspace_members).and_return(members_resource)
    # Simulate some users succeeding and others failing
  end
  ```

**Edge Cases (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Lines 117, 163, 202, 217, 227: Various error conditions
- Line 272: Workspace switching logic
- **Why Important**: Edge cases in workspace management can break multi-workspace setups

### 3. **AttioSyncJob** (97.26% covered, 2 lines uncovered)

**Rate Limit Retry Logic (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Lines 11-12: Rate limit retry with custom wait time
- **Why Important**: Critical for handling API rate limits gracefully
- **How to Cover**:
  ```ruby
  it "retries with server-specified wait time on rate limit" do
    error = Attio::RateLimitError.new("Rate limited")
    allow(error).to receive(:retry_after).and_return(120)
    # Test that job is rescheduled with 120 second wait
  end
  ```

### 4. **MetaInfo** (97.30% covered, 2 lines uncovered)

**Health Check Fallback (LOW PRIORITY)**
- Line 92: Fallback message when API is not operational
- Line 124: Client initialization fallback
- **Why Important**: Health monitoring for operations teams
- **How to Cover**: Test when Attio API is down

### 5. **Configuration** (97.62% covered, 1 line uncovered)

**Client Initialization (LOW PRIORITY)**
- Line 52: Direct Attio client initialization
- **Why Important**: Fallback when Rails.cache isn't available
- **How to Cover**: Test in non-Rails environment

## Recommended Test Additions (Priority Order)

### High Priority Tests (Critical for Production)

1. **Rate Limit Handling Test**
   ```ruby
   # spec/attio/rails/jobs/attio_sync_job_spec.rb
   describe "rate limit retry" do
     it "uses server-provided retry_after value" do
       # Test the retry_on block execution
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Deal Sync Error Recovery**
   ```ruby
   # spec/attio/rails/concerns/dealable_spec.rb
   describe "error recovery" do
     it "handles API errors gracefully when syncing won deals" do
       # Test error handling in sync_won_deal
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Batch Operation Failures**
   ```ruby
   # spec/attio/rails/workspace_manager_spec.rb
   describe "batch operations" do
     it "reports partial failures correctly" do
       # Test mixed success/failure in batch operations
     end
   end
   ```

### Medium Priority Tests (Important Edge Cases)

1. **Deal Value Calculation Fallbacks**
   ```ruby
   it "falls back to amount when value is not available" do
     deal = DealWithAmount.new(amount: 5000)
     expect(deal.send(:deal_value)).to eq(5000)
   end
   ```

2. **Callback Error Handling**
   ```ruby
   it "handles errors in before_sync callbacks" do
     deal_class.before_attio_deal_sync { raise "Callback error" }
     # Test that error is handled appropriately
   end
   ```

### Low Priority Tests (Completeness)

1. **Configuration Edge Cases**
2. **MetaInfo Health Check Messages**
3. **Stage Field Resolution Logic**

## Summary

The codebase has excellent coverage at 94.76%. The uncovered code primarily consists of:
- **Error handling paths** (most critical)
- **Fallback logic** (medium importance)
- **Edge cases** (lower priority)

To reach 100% coverage meaningfully:
1. Focus on error handling paths first (high business impact)
2. Add tests for rate limiting and retry logic
3. Cover batch operation failure scenarios
4. Test various field configuration fallbacks

The current 94.76% coverage is already production-ready. Adding the high-priority tests would bring coverage to ~96-97% while significantly improving confidence in error handling.
