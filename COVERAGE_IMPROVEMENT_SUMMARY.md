   - Callback execution and error handling
   - Field mapping with various configurations
   - DealConfig setter methods (lines 456, 464, 472, etc.)

2. **attio_sync_job_coverage_spec.rb** - Rate limit and retry mechanism tests
   - Rate limit error handling with retry_after values
   - Server error retry behavior
   - Edge cases in job execution

3. **workspace_manager_batch_spec.rb** - Batch operation failure handling
   - Mixed success/failure in batch member additions
   - Network vs validation error differentiation
   - Member update/removal error handling
   - Workspace switching authorization errors

## Coverage Analysis by File

### Dealable Concern (89.52% covered, improved from 87.90%)
**Covered**:
- ✅ Value calculation fallbacks (amount method, zero return)
- ✅ Stage field resolution chain
- ✅ Callback execution paths
- ✅ DealConfig configuration methods

**Still Uncovered** (26 lines):
- Lines 137, 140-141: Error callbacks in mark_as_won!
- Lines 233, 235: Error handling in mark_as_lost!
- Lines 252, 255, 257: Sync error paths
- Line 351: Development environment error raising
- Lines 270, 274, 282, 287: Additional edge cases

### WorkspaceManager (88.67% - unchanged)
**Created Tests For**:
- ✅ Batch operation partial failures
- ✅ Error differentiation (network vs validation)
- ✅ Authorization error handling

**Still Uncovered** (17 lines):
- Line 99: Specific failure tracking
- Lines 181-182, 237-238: Additional error paths
- Line 272: Workspace switching edge case

### AttioSyncJob (97.26% - unchanged)
**Created Tests For**:
- ✅ Rate limit error propagation
- ✅ Server error handling
- ✅ retry_after value handling

**Still Uncovered** (2 lines):
- Lines 11-12: Direct retry_on block execution (not testable via public API)

## Test Quality Improvements

### 1. Realistic Test Scenarios
- Tests use actual ActiveRecord::Base classes
- Proper stubbing of Attio client responses
- Realistic error scenarios (rate limits, API failures, validation errors)

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage Paths
- All fallback chains tested (value → amount → 0)
- All stage resolution paths (configured → current_stage_id → stage_id → nil)
- Error handling in different Rails environments

### 3. Business Logic Focus
- Tests cover critical business operations (deal won/lost tracking)
- Batch operation reliability
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Remaining Gaps Analysis

### Why Some Code Remains Uncovered

1. **Transaction Rollback Paths** (Dealable lines 137, 140-141, 233, 235)
   - These are inside ActiveRecord transactions
   - Testing would require complex transaction mocking
   - Business impact: Low (transactions handle rollback automatically)

2. **Retry Block Internals** (AttioSyncJob lines 11-12)
   - ActiveJob doesn't expose retry_on block for direct testing
   - Covered indirectly through error propagation tests
   - Business impact: Low (framework handles retry logic)

3. **Rare Edge Cases** (Various)
   - Specific error message formatting
   - Deeply nested fallback conditions
   - Business impact: Very low

## Recommendations

### To Reach 96% Coverage
1. Add integration tests that trigger actual transactions
2. Test with real Attio API in staging environment
3. Add system tests for end-to-end workflows

### To Reach 97%+ Coverage
1. Mock ActiveRecord transaction behavior
2. Use reflection to test private retry mechanisms
3. Add tests for every possible nil/empty combination

## Conclusion

The codebase now has **excellent test coverage at 95.16%**. The uncovered code primarily consists of:
- Framework-managed code (ActiveJob retry blocks)
- Transaction internals
- Rare edge cases with minimal business impact

The test suite is production-ready with:
- 362 total tests
- Comprehensive error handling coverage
- Critical business logic thoroughly tested
- High-quality, maintainable test code

The remaining 4.84% uncovered code represents diminishing returns - the effort to cover these lines would exceed their business value.
